              <p>It is possible to apply for an e-visa for Russia. However,
                they are only for three regions (The Far East, St Petersburg
                and Leningrad region, and Kaliningrad). There are different
                e-visas for each region, therefore you will not be able to
                travel to the other regions without a full Russian visa. For
                a full Russian visa, you will need to go manually, not through
                an e-visa. The electronic visas are also only available
                for a short period of time, eg. 8 days.
