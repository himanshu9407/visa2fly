      <h2>Destination Russia</h2>
      <p>
        Russia is a popular tourist attraction due to its rich culture and heritage, and stunning world-
        famous museums. Saint Petersburg is one of the most visited cities in Europe owing to its
        magnificent museums, churches, theatres, and fortifications. The Russian government
        implemented the e-visa program from 2019 onwards which enabled Indian visitors to procure
        a Russian Visa minus the hassle. Before COVID-19, nearly 1 lakh Russian visas were issued
        to Indian nationals and over 1.5 lakh Indian visitors visited the country in the same year.
        Although Russia isn’t necessarily a popular tourist attraction to Indians, it is surely a
        memorable place to visit.

      <h2>Covid-19 Travel Plans?</h2>
      <p>
        Due to COVID-19, worldwide air travel has slowed down and come to a halt in many
        countries. Russia too has not opened up its borders yet but as the vaccines are rolled out and
        the conditions get better, we can expect air-travel and tourism to resume soon, keeping in
        mind that some restrictions and regulations must be followed even after. Indian nationals can
        apply for a Russian visa and they must check the COVID-19 test requirements their airline
        has implemented before their flight. Different airlines have different requirements and
        express PCR COVID-19 tests are available at Moscow too. The Russian government requires
        all arriving passengers to present a negative COVID-19 certificate (test taken not more than
        72 hours before the flight). The certificate must be in English or Russian. While travelling
        domestically in Russia, visitors must follow the guidelines and rules mandated by the
        authorities.

      <h2>Rustic Germany</h2>
      <p>
        Indian tourists, in particular, enjoy visiting the Schengen Area, which includes Germany too.
        German visas and Schengen visas are highly sought after by Indian tourists as this region is
        very rich in scenic tourism. The tourist season is usually from May through September. Not
        only is it a geographical gem, but the historic castle, cities and architecture also add to the
        scenic beauty. The Berlin Wall is probably the most popular tourist attraction in the capital
        city due to its historic significance. Another popular tourist attraction for Indian travellers is
        the city of Munich. Munich is known for its beautiful parks, museums, churches and palaces
        which showcase stunning medieval-Germany architecture. Oktoberfest is a festival which is
        celebrated for over 2 weeks all over the country. The festival is a beer festival and is
        celebrated every autumn!

      <h2>Russia – A Blend of Rich Culture &amp; Wilderness</h2>
      <p>
        Indians and Russians are very similar in the way that both cultures are immensely proud of
        their heritage and history which greatly influences their lives. Depending on which region of
        Russia you visit, there are a lot of things you can do. There are many historically significant
        and beautiful places in Russia like the Moscow Kremlin, the Winter Palace, and the Red
        Square. Russia has some of the most remarkable museums and the State Hermitage Museum
        (founded in 1764) is the 8 th most visited museum in the world! If you are inclined towards
        nature and adventure, you must visit Lake Baikal, the Russian Taiga Forest, the Kamchatka
        Volcanoes, the Western Caucasus, and the many other stunning natural attractions that Russia
        is home to.

        For Indian tourists, splitting a week between Moscow and Saint Petersburg is the best if they
        wish to enjoy a historic and cultural tour as these two cities have many places to visit and
        they portray the essence of Russia. Since a majority of Russians don’t speak English, you
        may need to hire a translator or carry around a dictionary or any other device or app that can
        help you translate the languages.
