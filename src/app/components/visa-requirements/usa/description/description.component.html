      <h3>What USA Offers</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the size of the country, it is impossible to see and experience everything in a single
        trip. You must research properly and decide the cities (or states) you wish to see and the
        kind of experiences you want. Almost all the states have unique landmarks or attractions that
        tourists must visit. Times Square (New York), Grand Canyon (Arizona), Statue of Liberty
        (New York), White House (Washington D.C), Las Vegas Strip (Nevada) and the Kennedy
        Space Centre (Florida) are some of the most popular tourist attractions in the country. There
        are 24 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in America, out of which 12 are National Parks and 10
        are cultural sites. You’ll find natural attractions, historic buildings and sites, museums, clubs
        and beaches across the country. Las Vegas is the perfect destination for those looking for an
        exciting and entertaining vacation; for a tranquil and relaxing holiday, Hawaii’s beaches are
        the place to go! There is so much to see, do and experience that it is guaranteed to be a
        holiday you won’t forget! You can apply for an India to USA visa at Visa2fly! We assist with

      <h3>U.S. Visa: Post COVID-19</h3>
      <p>
        The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people all over the world. Travel and tourism has also
        been greatly impacted by the pandemic. The United States too has been affected by it as all
        countries were forced to restrict international travel and tourism for some months. The
        vaccines are a ray of hope as once people are vaccinated and the conditions get better,
        people can start exploring the world again and the United States too can welcome tourists to
        explore their cities, culture and wilderness. Tourists must ensure that they have a valid US
        Visa and must also follow all the rules and regulations mandated. You can easily apply for a
        U.S. visa online! Make sure you fill your online visa application USA properly and well in
        advance to ensure a hassle free process.

      <h3>Weather, Transportation and Culture</h3>
      <p>
        Given America’s large expanse, the climate varies across the country. The US is divided into
        six climatic zones (Hawaii and Alaska excluded); Northwest Pacific, Mid/South Pacific,
        Midwest, Northeast, Southeast and the Southwest. The Western and Southern parts are
        generally warmer and the Eastern and Northern parts are usually colder. The best time to
        visit America is from May to September but make sure you check the weather of the places
        you visit before.
      </p>

      <p>
        The United States has plenty of transportation options to choose from. Most of the major
        cities and towns have well-developed local transportation systems like railways, metros and
        buses but visitors can also choose to hire Ubers or Lyfts. As the country is geographically
        wide, the country is well connected and you can travel via flights or trains from one state to
        another.
      </p>

      <p>
        The United States of America is probably one of the most diverse counties on the planet and
        the culture is heavily influenced by the enormous number of immigrants that have settled
        there over the years. The culture is influenced by the Native Americans, Asians, Caucasians,
        Latinos, Africans and many other communities from around the world. Each state has its
        own essence and its unique cuisines, customs and traditions. There is never a dull moment
        here as there is a celebration of something almost every other day! The fusion of so many
        diverse cultures and races is truly heart-warming and brings out the best of humanity. Some
        festivals and events you must attend are the Kutztown Folk Festival (Pennsylvania), Mardi
        Gras (Louisiana), Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta (New Mexico), Boston Seafood
        Festival (Massachusetts) and the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival (California). To
        experience these mesmerizing events, complete your online visa application USA at
