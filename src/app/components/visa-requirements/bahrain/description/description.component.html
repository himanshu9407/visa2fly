      <h3>Experiences Bahrain Offers!</h3>
      <p>
        Depending on what you wish to see and do, there is plenty of both in Bahrain. If you like
        history, you must visit the Qalat al Bahrain or the Bahrain Fort which is a UNESCO World
        Heritage site. It is considered to be the capital of the Dilmun Era and the site has a museum
        which you can visit too. Other historic monuments you can visit are Al Fateh Grand Mosque
        (the biggest in Bahrain), Abdullah Al Zayed House, Kukar House, Muharraq pearling path
        and Bu Maher Fort. You can buy traditional ceramics at the A’Ali pottery district or visit the
        Manama Wednesday market where you can find other traditional handcrafted items for sale.
        Manama is also regarded as a shopper’s paradise; Bab Al-Bahrain Souk offers visitors a
        traditional and authentic experience of the culture of the Arabian Gulf. Manama is also home
        to Bahrain’s largest shopping centre with over 300 shops. Bahrain is also popular for its
        tranquil beaches. Al Jazayer and Solymar are a couple of popular beaches. They sometimes
        host fun events and activities too. The Manama skyline too is absolutely stunning to gaze at!
        Wahooo! Waterpark, Azizia Bird Kingdom and Dive Bahrain are a few other theme parks you
        can visit. You must also visit the Tree of Life, an ancient tree that survives in the middle of a
        desert with no other vegetation around. While in Bahrain, you must indulge in the
        spectacular and delicious food and cuisines that they offer. If you’re feeling adventurous, you
        can go pearl fishing or even swim across from one island to another!

      <h3>Post-COVID-19 Travel</h3>
      <p>
        Due to COVID-19, the travel and tourism industry has come to a halt. A few countries have
        resumed domestic tourism but are wary of opening their international borders. As the
        population worldwide is being inoculated, the travel and tourism industry can once again be
        expected to thrive and rapidly grow. Bahrain is expected to welcome international tourists to
        their shores soon. Tourists and travellers must have a valid Bahrain Visa and must make
        sure they follow all the rules and regulations that the authorities put in place to ensure a
        hassle-free interaction, for both the visitors and the locals. You can find details on how to get
        Bahrain Visa from India here.

      <h3>Weather, Transportation and Culture</h3>
      <p>
        Being in the Middle East, Bahrain experiences an arid climate. The summers are extremely
        hot while the winters are relatively mild. It gets extremely hot and humid in the summers
        which can be very uncomfortable for visitors. In the winters the temperature ranges between
        10 and 20 °C so the best time to visit Bahrain is from November to March.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bahrain is well connected and the two popular forms of public transport are Buses and
        Taxis. The Buses are relatively cheaper but are air-conditioned and comfortable. The Taxis
        have two different fares; the day fare and the night fare. Separate taxis to the airport can be
        easily availed. Monorails are under construction and will hopefully be open to public use
        soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bahrain’s culture is a part of the historical region of Eastern Arabia which heavily influences
        the modern culture and lifestyle of people too. Being liberal and tolerant of other cultures, the
        locals are ethnically very diverse. You will easily spot churches and temples here too. The
        culture influence can be observed even in the cuisine too which is heavenly and something
        you must try!
