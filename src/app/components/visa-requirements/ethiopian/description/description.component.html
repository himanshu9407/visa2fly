          World Heritage site) is the best place for you! Reggae music fans must visit the Shashemen
          village where one can closely observe the connection between Jamaica and Ethiopia and
          the music. Ethiopia is very significant to followers of Rastafarianism which is depicted
          through their songs. You can also participate in some interesting and unique festivals like
          Ganna, Timkat and Enkutatash.

        <h3>Post COVID-19</h3>
        <p>
          The travel and tourism industry contributed about 5-6% of the country’s GDP each year. This
          is expected to increase as the government is trying to encourage more tourists to come
          explore the greatness of this land but COVID-19 put a pause on the tourism industry and
          caused a setback to these numbers. As the vaccines are rolled out and more people get
          inoculated, Ethiopia is expected to soon reopen their borders to welcome tourists from all
          over. Tourists and travellers must have a valid Ethiopia tourist Visa and must also make sure
          to follow all the rules and regulations that the authorities dictate. If you’re planning to visit,
          you can easily apply for an Ethiopia Visa online.

        <h3>Weather, Transportation and Culture</h3>
        <p>
          Ethiopia’s weather changes according to the altitude and geographic conditions but the
          country has very little variations throughout the year. From November to February, the days
          are more pleasant and cooler and hence this is the best time to visit Ethiopia. Plan your
          itinerary well and then research about the places you wish to visit. You can then accordingly
          decide the period you want to visit Ethiopia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethiopia is fairly well-connected by different means of local transport. In the towns,
          minibuses are a common form of transport. Taxis operate in the larger towns but make sure
          to ask your accommodation or hotel for an estimate as they tend to charge foreigners extra
          money. Bajajs (motorised rickshaws) can be found anywhere and are very easily accessible
          and relatively cheap.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethiopia is culturally very diverse and rich. There are over 50 unique tribes that live here
          along with other cultures. Tourists are also welcome to visit some of these tribes in the Omo
          Valley region like the Hamer Tribe. Ethiopia is a bit conservative so people, including
          tourists, are expected to dress appropriately with their knees and shoulders covered. Make
          sure you take light and breezy clothes as it does get pretty hot.
