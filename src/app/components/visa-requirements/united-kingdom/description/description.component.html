      <h3>Weather and Transportation</h3>
      <p>
        The best time to visit the UK is from April to September as the weather is pleasant during
        these months. The UK does tend to get very chilly in the winters with temperatures dropping
        below 0 and snow but you can still visit if that is what you wish to experience. The UK does
        not have any fixed monsoon months so it can rain anytime. Make sure you know the weather
        forecast and carry an umbrella if needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The UK is well connected by buses, coaches, metros, trains, trams and taxis. Buses and
        local trains are the most common and cheap form of public transport. You can easily get
        tickets at booths or even have a pass made or pre-book a taxi to the train station or airport.
        You shouldn’t have much trouble accessing them and you can also see their schedules
        online.

      <h3>COVID-19 Travel</h3>
      <p>
        The UK is one of the worse affected nations in this worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. The
        pandemic greatly impacted the tourism industry of the nation as well as the livelihoods of
        those dependent on it. The country has already started inoculating their people against the
        virus and we can expect them to soon open the borders and permit travel and tourism
        activities. Travellers must make sure that they take all the mandatory precautions and follow
        all the rules and regulations mandated by the authorities to ensure that their travel is
        hassle-free. You will require a valid UK Visa to enter the country for which you can easily
        apply for UK Visa online too.
