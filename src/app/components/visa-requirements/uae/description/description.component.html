      <h2>The 7 Emirates:</h2>
      <h3>Abu Dhabi</h3>
      <p>
        The city of Abu Dhabi is the capital of the UAE and the Emirate is situated near the Persian
        Gulf. This is the largest Emirate and has some of the most stunning architecture, lavish and
        grand mosques, the best theme parks, deserts and intriguing museums. What once used to
        be a fishing village, has now been transformed into one of the most deluxe, rich and modern
        cities in the world! Abu Dhabi is generally hot throughout the year, but the temperatures are
        pleasant from November to March which is ideal to visit. There is so much to do in Abu
        Dhabi, from kayaking through mangroves, off-roading in the dunes to witnessing tranquil
        scenes off the shores of the Zaya Nurai Island. The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, Louvre
        Museum, Ferrari World and the Emirates Palace are just a few of the popular tourist
        attractions here.

        most popular tourist attractions are the Al Bidyah Mosque, the Fujairah Fort, the Bithnah Fort
        and the Sheikh Zayed Mosque. The forts aren’t as magnificent as the ones in the rest of the

      <h3>COVID-19 Travel</h3>
      <p>
        COVID-19 has forced the tourism and travel industry worldwide to a standstill. Dubai and
        Abu Dhabi alone attracted thousands, if not millions of tourists each year before COVID-19.
        The kind of luxury and culture that you can experience in the UAE is unmatched anywhere
        else in the world. As populations across the world are being inoculated against COVID-19
        and as the situation gets better, the UAE may soon resume travel and tourism. Necessary
        precautions and regulations will be put in place to ensure the safety of both tourists and
        citizens which must be respected and followed. If you are planning to visit the UAE, you
        must have a valid UAE tourist visa and you also are required to submit a negative COVID-19
        PCR test. Make sure you apply for your UAE visa well in advance and book your tickets
        accordingly.
